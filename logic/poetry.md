The poetry.toml and poetry.lock files are both used by the Poetry package manager for Python, but they serve different purposes.

The poetry.toml file is a configuration file that describes the Python project, including its dependencies, build system, and other settings. It specifies the direct dependencies required for the project, along with their version requirements. The poetry.toml file is meant to be committed to version control, so that other developers can easily recreate the same environment.

The poetry.lock file, on the other hand, is a generated file that records the exact versions of all the dependencies, including indirect dependencies, installed for a project. It is generated automatically by Poetry when you run poetry install. This file is not meant to be edited by hand and is generated automatically by Poetry, so it should not be committed to version control.

The purpose of the poetry.lock file is to ensure that everyone who works on the project, including other developers and deployment systems, uses exactly the same versions of the dependencies. This ensures that the project works consistently and predictably, regardless of where it is run.

In summary, the poetry.toml file describes the project and its dependencies, while the poetry.lock file records the exact versions of the dependencies that were installed for the project. Both files are important for managing the dependencies of your Python projects and ensuring that they work consistently across different environments.
